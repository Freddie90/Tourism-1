### Getting Started

####What is this Application

######Tourism globally accounts for 10% of the worlds GDP and supports about 1 out of 11 jobs around the world. It is only logical to assume that there may be problems to occur. A few minor problems would be booking systems, passport systems, recommendation systems and so forth. 
######Looking at booking an airing ticket to a certain destination or rather planning a trip, meaning taking varicose routes to the destination could bring up some flaws in the system that could need adjusting. An example to this would be booking dates of flite time. This System is ment to tackle each individual entity within the booking system for flights within a tourist system and take this on as my problem domain.
